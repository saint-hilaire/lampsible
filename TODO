* FIX PHP
* FIX MYSQL
* SSL
* DEAL WITH CREDENTIALS AND SECRETS:
  * Database
  * SSH keys
  * Maybe sudo passwords / SSH login passwords
* MAKE EVERYTHING IDEMPOTENT
* BETTER ACTION PARSING
* Use Ansible's tags to control which playbooks/roles should run. ( https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_tags.html )
* Properly use Ansible Runner's Input Directory Hierarchy (i.e. implement/refactor
  the method init_directories). ( https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/runner/en/stable/intro/ )
* Deal with environment variables.
* Implement support for project_dir?
* TODO: One big open question in all of this is whether we need all of
  these files and directories, or if we can pass all of this configuration
  to ansible_runner as in-memory variables - also, to what extent we
  want to enable users to provide their own configuration files.
* Option to print the Ansible command that would be executed, instead of actually
  executing it.
* TODO: There is a lot that can be done here, see:
  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_inventory.html#developing-inventory
* TODO: Also, give the user options to read inventories from existing
  files/directories, so they define their own confiugs.
* An "Inventory-Dictionary" could look like this, for example:
# TODO
# This might be possible...
#inventory={
#    'all': {
#        'host': {},
#        'vars': {},
#    },
#    '_meta': {
#        'hostvars': {}
#    }
#},
# Or maybe this...
# inventory = {
#     'ungrouped': {
#         'hosts': {
#             host: {'ansible_user': user}
#         },
#     },
# }

* TODO: It is probably also possible to specify the user(s)
  via env/cmdline. That way, we wouldn't have to deal with users
  at all here. But I'm still not sure, how exactly I
  want to do this in the long run anyway.
  https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/runner/en/stable/intro/
* Some other attributes we can and probably should pass to the
  RunnerConfig constructor:
# TODO: Apparently, RunnerConfig still requires a playbook,
# which makes this somewhat moot.
# roles_path='apt-update'

# TODO: See the possible attributes of the RunnerConfig class.
# ssh_key_data=TODO
# passwords=TODO
# artifacts_dir=TODO
# cmdline_args=TODO
# envvars=TODO
# extra_vars=TODO
# roles_path=TODO
# tags=TODO
# skip_tags=TODO
# TODO: container stuff
