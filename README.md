# Lampsible

## In progress...

## Installling

* Install depencies (ideally in a virtualenv): `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Install a needed Ansible module with Ansible Galaxy (this is an ugly temporary workaround which will hopefully be improved soon. It does not honor your virtual environment if you have it, but installs (on my machine at least) to ~/.ansible/): `ansible-galaxy collection install community.crypto`

## Usage

For now: `python main.py --help`  

This will be improved in the future.
